During the web development bootcamp we worked in groups of 2 people to develop a webshop.

For the project we worked with the PHP framework Laravel.

Anas Zorom has worked on the client side of the webshop. Dennis Visser has set up the data model of the webshop and created the admin dashboard of the webshop.

However, the project is far from finished.
